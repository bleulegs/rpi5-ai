# 2025 Innovation Source Code

This repository is all of our source code to make an AI operated robotic shark.

You can locate the AI model stuff in /ai. We use ``hailo-ai/hailo-rpi5-examples`` for the GStreamer pipelines and use a custom YoloV11M model for object detection for sharks.

The webcam IP stream repository can be located inside /ip-cam or [here](https://github.com/linuskang/mjpg-streamer)

Arduino source code for the servo controls and ESC motor controls can be found insiide /arduino.
